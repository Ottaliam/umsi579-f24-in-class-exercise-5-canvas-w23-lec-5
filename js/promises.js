// PROMISES!
// Some learners find Promises a bit difficult to understand.
//
// In this course, you'll only deal with fetch() related promises/
// So, when in doubt, start with this snippet:
/*
fetch('https://some-url.com')
 .then((res) => res.json())
 .then((json) => {
    console.log('here is your fetch result! Do stuff with it!', json)
 })
 .catch((error) => {
    console.warn('here is your fetch error! Fix the error!', error)
 });

// For now just keep two things in mind
// - Responses can be huge, so getting data from the response (such as json()) is also
//   returned as a promise.
// - Responses can have different structures so we need the flexibility to choose how
//   to parse the response contents.
